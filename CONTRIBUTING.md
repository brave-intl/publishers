We like to make sure that all contributions follow a few guidelines, which will increase the likelihood of a merge:

- Follow the [code review guildelines][codereview]
- Write tests to cover critical functionality
- Write a [good commit message][commit]
- Leave code better than you found it, whenever possible:
  - eliminate [callbacks][callbacks], use a service object instead
  - use [dependency injection][di] to encourage modularity, [an example][di-ex]
  - follow Sandi Metz' [rules][sm]
  - prefer [composition over inheritance][composition]
