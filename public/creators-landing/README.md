# :wave: Get started

This project is built using the React framework [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io), [Brave UI](https://github.com/brave/brave-ui) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics).

**Note:** For now, you have to remove the node modules folder from the root publishers directory to build this.

To start the build locally and edit files in real time run:

### 1. `yarn`

This installs the necessary dependencies.

### 2. `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### 3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This command also runs to update the Rails public folder so the most up-to-date version is going to be deployed.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
