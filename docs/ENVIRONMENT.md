# Environment Variables and Configuration

Configuration is set in [config/secrets.yml](https://github.com/brave/publishers/blob/master/config/secrets.yml) via environment variables.

We use the [dotenv gem](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to load variables specified in `.env` into the rails app, only in the `development` and `test` environments. This makes sure they are only loaded for the context of the running rails app and that they don't pollute the shell environment.

In the Next app, if not using Docker, you'll want to copy over the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and set the appropriate
variables there.
