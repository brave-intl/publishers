        intro: |
          Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a method of confirming your identity
          by using two different forms of verification when you access Brave
          Payments in order to increase security (recommended for protecting your
          account).

              Authenticator app provides a good fallback method to log

              hardware security key.

            Security key is a small device that connects to your computer via a
            USB port and works with FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F).
            You will be asked to insert and press the key instead of typing in a
            code.
