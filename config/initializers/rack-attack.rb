  ### Configure Cache ###

  # If you don't want to use Rails.cache (Rack::Attack's default), then
  # configure it here.
  #
  # Note: The store is only used for throttling (not blacklisting and
  # whitelisting). It must implement .increment and .write like
  # ActiveSupport::Cache::Store

  # Rack::Attack.cache.store = ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore.new

  ### Throttle Spammy Clients ###

  # If any single client IP is making tons of requests, then they're
  # probably malicious or a poorly-configured scraper. Either way, they
  # don't deserve to hog all of the app server's CPU. Cut them off!
  #
  # Note: If you're serving assets through rack, those requests may be
  # counted by rack-attack and this throttle may be activated too
  # quickly. If so, enable the condition to exclude them from tracking.

  # Throttle all requests by IP (60rpm)
  #
  # Key: "rack::attack:#{Time.now.to_i/:period}:req/ip:#{req.remote_ip}"
  throttle("req/ip", limit: 300, period: 5.minutes) do |req|
    req.remote_ip if !req.path.start_with?("/assets")
  end

  blocklist('fail2ban pentesters') do |req|
    # `filter` returns truthy value if request fails, or if it's from a previously banned IP
    # so the request is blocked
    Rack::Attack::Fail2Ban.filter("pentesters-#{req.remote_ip}", maxretry: 3, findtime: 1.hour, bantime: 7.days) do
      # The count for the IP is incremented if the return value is truthy
      CGI.unescape(req.query_string) =~ %r{/etc/passwd} ||
      req.path.include?('/etc/passwd') ||
      req.path.include?('wp-admin') ||
      req.path.include?('wp-login')

  ### Prevent Brute-Force Login Attacks ###

  # The most common brute-force login attack is a brute-force password
  # attack where an attacker simply tries a large number of emails and
  # passwords to see if any credentials match.
  #
  # Another common method of attack is to use a swarm of computers with
  # different IPs to try brute-forcing a password for a specific account.

  # denied, but that"s not very common and shouldn"t happen to you. (Knock
  # on wood!)
