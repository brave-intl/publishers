p Thank you for using the Brave referral system. We have a pretty important change coming up and we wanted to give you advance notice.

p The per user payout rate will be changing from $5 globally to variable rates depending upon the region of the user

strong Why are we doing this?

p
  div When we launched the referral program, the goal was to discover which areas would we see the most growth and to test the viability of the referral program as a whole. Our level of zoom was pretty wide (Planet Earth) and the rate was $5 per user, globally.
  div Since then, we have launched our Ads program and we want to shift our level of zoom to more regional efforts, with a specific focus on the areas where we can deliver ads.  This is a straightforward business decision.

br
strong When will this occur?
