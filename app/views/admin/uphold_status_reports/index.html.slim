  h4 Uphold Reports

div
  .font-weight-bold How this works:
  p Anytime a publisher connects their uphold account we create an entry in our database that logs this. If an uphold id has already been reported we do not create an entry. This data is then aggregated and grouped by month and displayed here.

table.table
  thead
    tr
      td Period
      td Number of users
      td
  tbody
    - @uphold_status_reports.each do |report|
      tr
        td
          - date = report.as_json.first
          = Date::MONTHNAMES[date.second]
          = " #{date.first}"
        td= report.as_json.second
        td= link_to("Download", admin_uphold_status_report_path(date.join('-')), class:'btn btn-default')
