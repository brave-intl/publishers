# Creators

Creators powers the <https://creators.brave.com> platform and enables content creators to be tipped from Brave users using the [Brave Rewards](https://brave.com/brave-rewards/) system.

It allows a creator to connect channels where they are hosted content as well as a wallet through which we deposit auto-contribute suggestions.

The ledger for current creator balance is stored in [bat-ledger](https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger), also known as eyeshade.

Creators is powered by Ruby on Rails and React w/NextJS
